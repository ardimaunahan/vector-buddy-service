# Vector Buddy's Local Web Server
This Node.js application is an essential component to the 
**Vector Buddy** Bixby capsule. This must be setup properly in order to:
- Make Vector say something
- Get Vector's battery status 
- ...and more to come!

# How to Setup
1. Setup Vector SDK by following the **Installation** steps [here](https://developer.anki.com/vector/docs/initial.html).
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`.
4. Expose your local web server publicly so that the Bixby capsule can connect to it. You can learn how from this [article](https://medium.com/botfuel/how-to-expose-a-local-development-server-to-the-internet-c31532d741cc). 
5. Install **Vector Buddy** from your Samsung phone's Marketplace.

That's it! Have fun and more features will be added in future releases!
